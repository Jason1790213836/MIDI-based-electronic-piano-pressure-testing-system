# MIDI-based-electronic-piano-pressure-testing-system
Developed a MIDI-based electronic piano pressure testing system to visualize the pressure of each key in real time, enabling doctors to monitor sensor responses as a potential therapy tool for hearing-impaired patients.Implemented Python scripts to build a standalone desktop app without requiring a Python environment. Each keystroke displays pressure values on the screen, while the system automatically exports final results into an Excel file stored on the userâ€™s desktop.
